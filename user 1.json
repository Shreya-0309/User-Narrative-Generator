  "review": "Good scale for the money. Typical AWS quality.\n\nEasy to use and easy to read display. Accurate for determining shipping weights. I just shipped a large 33.4 lb package today (AMS scale wt = UPS scale wt).\n\nI've even used it to weigh newborn kittens, so it has been quite handy for me. The provided AC adapter is a definite plus (don't have to worry about batteries). Lightweight, easy to carry around.\n\n4 Stars, only because of the plastic tray. I would've preferred an aluminum one, like my other AWS scale has. Other than that, well worth the money!",
