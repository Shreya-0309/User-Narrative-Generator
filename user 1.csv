A101G2KLTWSA51,B004W7IOV4,"American Weigh Scales PS-25 Table Top Postal Scale, Black"," Office & School Supplies - Envelopes, Mailers & Shipping Supplies - Postal Scales",17.75,4,"Good scale for the money. Typical AWS quality.

Easy to use and easy to read display. Accurate for determining shipping weights. I just shipped a large 33.4 lb package today (AMS scale wt = UPS scale wt).

I've even used it to weigh newborn kittens, so it has been quite handy for me. The provided AC adapter is a definite plus (don't have to worry about batteries). Lightweight, easy to carry around.

4 Stars, only because of the plastic tray. I would've preferred an aluminum one, like my other AWS scale has. Other than that, well worth the money!","This customer's purchase history demonstrates a strong interest in office supplies and organization, with a focus on efficiency and value.
